# DESCRIPTION:

The Generative Text Tool is a Python script designed to create new, coherent text based on patterns learned from a training corpus. It utilizes a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network, which is a type of recurrent neural network particularly effective for sequential data like text.

## Key Features and Functionality
**Character-Level Text Generation**:

- The model is trained on characters, not words.

- It treats the text as a sequence of individual characters, which allows it to learn spelling, punctuation, and grammar-like structure over time.

- Enables finer control and creativity compared to word-level models.
2. **Seed Text (Starting Prompt)**:

- The model requires an initial input string (seed) to begin generating new text.

- This seed text is a short sequence (e.g., 100 characters) that serves as context for the model to start predicting the next character.
3. **Temperature Control**:
  
- Temperature is a parameter used to control the randomness of predictions:

- Low temperature (e.g., 0.2–0.5): Makes the model more confident and conservative. It will choose the most likely next character, leading to more predictable and repetitive output.

- High temperature (e.g., 1.0–1.5): Increases randomness. The model will take more risks, which can lead to creative but less coherent outputs.
4.**Model Architecture**:
  
The model uses

- Embedding layer to convert character indices into dense vector representations.

- LSTM layers to capture long-term dependencies in character sequences.

- Dense layer with softmax activation to predict the probability distribution over the next possible characters.

In essence, this tool demonstrates the fundamental principles of how neural networks can learn to generate human-like text by predicting subsequent characters in a sequence.
